\chapter{Appendices}

Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copies of ethics approvals (required if obtained)
\item
  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects.
\item
  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.

\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.

\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
submitted separately.
