\chapter{Background}
This chapter explores various works done by the industry and researchers as a collective which has allowed for this project to be explored in-depth. 

\section{The Microservice Architecture}
Usually, a set of small loosely coupled components that can be deployed, scaled and tested independently which make up for a cloud-native application, more commonly known as the Microservice architecture. A major reason for the introduction of this architecture has been the ever-increasing demand for deploying cloud-native applications as various industries embrace a software-driven model. 

Using the microservice architecture comes with its own set of unique features, these features allow for new deployment patterns to be discussed and why this paper exists. 

Such features are listed below: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Highly maintainable and testable 
    \item Loosely coupled with other services 
    \item Independently deployable 
    \item Capable of being deployed by a smaller team
\end{itemize}

\section{Deployment Patterns}
There exist a few different patterns, however for the purposes of this dissertation a look into patterns set out by Chris Richardson, the author of Microservices patterns \cite{Chr19} would be more suitable. These patterns are used to deploy services in different manners to achieve various benefits, i.e cost-effectiveness, speed and scalability. During this dissertation the following are focused on; 

\subsection{Pattern 1: Single application per machine}

        \caption{An example application is used for visualizing the pattern mentioned here.}
    \end{figure}  

A basic pattern in which a single microservice application is deployed on one machine allows for a simple and cost-effective deployment depending on the use-case scenario. The ideal scenario would fit an application with a small user-base however would see themselves grow within the future to utilize the various advantages of the microservice architecture \cite{Chr19}.. 

\subsection{Pattern 2 : Single service instance per host pattern }
