\chapter{Background}
This chapter explores various works done by the industry as a collective which has allowed for this project to be explored in-depth. 

\section{The Microservice Architecture}
Usually a set of small loosely coupled components that can be deployed, scaled and tested independently making up for a cloud native application, more commonly known as the Microservice architecture.  A major reason for the introduction of this architecture has been the ever increasing demand of deploying cloud native applications as various industries embrace a software driven model. 

Using the microservice architecture comes with itâ€™s own set of unique features, these features allow for new deployment patterns to be discussed and why this paper exists. 

Such features are listed below: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Highly maintainable and testable 
    \item Loosely coupled with other services 
    \item Independently deployable 
    \item Capable of being deploying by a smaller team
\end{itemize}

\section{Deployment Patterns}
There a few different patterns set out by Chris Richardson, the author of Microservices patterns \cite{Chr19}. These are used to deploy services in different manners to achieve various benefits, i.e cost-effectiveness, speed and scalability. During this dissertation three (only really did 2 in the end) are focused on; 

\subsection{Pattern 1 : Single application per machine}

        \caption{An example application is used for visualizing the pattern mentioned here.}
    \end{figure}  

A basic pattern in which a single microservice application is deployed on one machine, this allows for a simple and cost effective deployment depending on the use-case scenario. The ideal scenario would fit an application with a small user-base however would see themselves grow within the future to utilize the various advantages of the microservice architecture.
