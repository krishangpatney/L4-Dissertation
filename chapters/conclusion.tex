\chapter{Conclusion}    
Summarise the whole project for a lazy reader who didn't read the rest (e.g. a prize-awarding committee).
\section{Future Works}

- There would be so much future work with this 
- use packer for creating images of applications 
- Deploy and Test Pattern 3 with the machines
- Deploy the machines on different cloud types which are provided 
- Use a standardized workload generator for each. 


\section{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Summarise briefly and fairly.
    \item
        You should be addressing the general problem you introduced in the
        Introduction.        
    \item
        Include summary of concrete results (``the new compiler ran 2x
        faster'')
    \item
        Indicate what future work could be done, but remember: \textbf{you
        won't get credit for things you haven't done}.
\end{itemize}
