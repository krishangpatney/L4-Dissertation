\chapter{Analysis and Requirements}
What is the problem that you want to solve, and how did you arrive at it?

In research projects, it will involve developing a design drawing on the work
established in the background, and stating how the space of possible projects was
sensibly narrowed down to what you have done

This section discusses the requirements of what needs to be research and analysis... 

With the microservice architecture being so versatile, it provides a developer flexibility while deploying their application to the cloud. As identified in the background, this paper tries to survey the different architectures using various applications with different  



\section{Research Objectives}
To create a suitable testing environment for the various patterns, the project has been split into the following:  
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{O1} Identify suitable patterns for microservice deployments. 
    \item \textbf{O2} Identify open-source applications based on the microservice architecture for test cases. 
    \item \textbf{O3} Create a modular and reproducible setup for deploying applications within different patterns. 
    \item \textbf{O4} Create a modular and reproducible setup for deploying load machines for the applications.
    \item \textbf{O5} Create a workflow for collecting and analysing machine and api metrics.
\end{itemize}
