and allowing for smaller businesses and people to use such services and host cloud native applications such as video hosting platforms, or ecommerce shops and social media platforms. 


Generation of people, population's increasing, internet connected devices being ever so available, way people use these devices has changed, so have applications which make these devices useful. computing power being mainstream, increase in users = needing to scale applications, micro services allows for this, and micro services allows flexibility in how to deploy. This then begs the question of  how and why deployment patterns matter, and a look into further.

Evolution often finds itself integrating with many things around us, in the case of software architecture, evolution has created an ever so beautiful architecture, based on running multiple independent services which communicate with each other over the internet, famously known as the Microservice Architecture. 

As we grow our footprint over the internet, applications need to also grow to support
