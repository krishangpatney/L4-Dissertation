    What will you be investigating (in plain-language, big picture-level)?
    Why is that worth investigating? How is it important to academia or business? How is it sufficiently original?
    What are your research aims and research question(s)? Note that the research questions can sometimes be presented at the end of the literature review (next chapter).
    What is the scope of your study? In other words, what will you cover and what wonâ€™t you cover?
    How will you approach your research? In other words, what methodology will you adopt?
    How will you structure your dissertation? What are the core chapters and what will you do in each of them?


\section{Motivation}
A shift in industry to cloud-native applications has been promoted over the last few years, with countless cloud services being provided by companies such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft. 


and allowing for smaller businesses and people to use such services and host cloud native applications such as video hosting platforms, or ecommerce shops and social media platforms. 


Generation of people, population's increasing, internet connected devices being ever so available, way people use these devices has changed, so have applications which make these devices useful. computing power being mainstream, increase in users = needing to scale applications, micro services allows for this, and micro services allows flexibility in how to deploy. This then begs the question of  how and why deployment patterns matter, and a look into further.

Evolution often finds itself integrating with many things around us, in the case of software architecture, evolution has created an ever so beautiful architecture, based on running multiple independent services which communicate with each other over the internet, famously known as the Microservice Architecture. 

As we grow our footprint over the internet, applications need to also grow to support
